# Archived Documentation

These files were consolidated into the main README.md for brevity. Kept here for reference.

## Files

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Detailed system architecture diagrams and component descriptions
- **MULTI_LANGUAGE_README.md** - Multi-language setup and protocol documentation  
- **QUICKSTART.md** - Extended quick start guide with more examples
- **RUST_ANALYZER_NOTES.md** - Rust-specific analyzer implementation notes
